## [1.4.11] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Critical Performance Regression**: Eliminated 80% performance regression in judge evaluation
  - **Root Cause**: API retry loop was making up to 3 API calls per parse failure instead of trying different parse strategies locally
  - **Solution**: Refactored to separate API retries from JSON parse retries
    - Single API call per judge evaluation (no retry loop)
    - Multi-strategy progressive JSON parsing on same response (4 strategies, <4ms total)
  - **Performance Improvement**:
    - Average job time: 9.1s → 5.2s (**-42.6%** faster)
    - Total session time: 292s → 167s (**-42.7%** faster)  
    - API cost reduction: **-60%** for judge evaluations
  - **Reliability**: Parse success rate maintained at 100% with Strategy 1 (standard extraction + sanitization)
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Added `parseJudgeResponseWithRetries()`: Progressive 4-strategy parser
      - Strategy 1 (standard): ExtractJSON → SanitizeJSON → Unmarshal
      - Strategy 2 (aggressive): ExtractJSON → RepairJSON → Unmarshal
      - Strategy 3 (multi-pass): Extract → Repair → Sanitize → Repair → Unmarshal
      - Strategy 4 (partial recovery): Lenient decoder for incomplete JSON
    - Removed obsolete `maxParseRetries`, `parseRetryDelay`, and `isJSONParseError()` function
    - Fixed linter warnings (ineffectual assignments)
- **JSON Parse Resilience**: Backup strategies available for edge cases without API overhead

### Changed
- Judge evaluation now makes exactly 1 API call per response (previously up to 3 on parse failure)
- Parse errors now trigger local repair strategies instead of API retries
- Removed artificial delays between parse attempts (was 1 second per retry)

### Performance
- **124.5 seconds saved** per 32-job session (from 291.9s to 167.4s)
- Zero API retry overhead for parse failures
- All parse attempts succeed with Strategy 1 (100% fast-path success)
- Time saved scales linearly with dataset size

### Documentation
- Created `REPORTS/PERFORMANCE_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_2025-10-31.md`: Root cause analysis
- Created `REPORTS/PERFORMANCE_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-10-31.md`: Implementation details
- Created `REPORTS/POST_FIX_SESSION_ANALYSIS_2025-10-31.md`: Real-world validation results

## [1.4.4] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- **Provider-Based Global Rate Limiting**: Major feature to prevent rate limit errors across multiple models sharing the same provider
  - `provider_rate_limits` configuration: Set global RPM limits per provider (nvidia, openai, anthropic, together, etc.)
  - Automatic provider detection from base URLs
  - Provider-level rate limiters override individual model limits
  - Prevents burst overages when multiple models share the same API endpoint
- **Configurable Burst Capacity**: Fine-tune rate limiter burst behavior
  - `provider_burst_percent` configuration (1-50%, default: 15%)
  - Higher burst (20-25%) improves throughput with 64+ workers
  - Lower burst (10-12%) reduces rate limit errors
  - Model-level limiters still use 20% burst (unchanged)
- **Performance Logging**: Added detailed API request and job processing metrics
  - `rate_limit_wait_ms`: Time spent waiting for rate limiter token
  - `api_duration_ms`: Actual LLM API call duration  
  - `total_ms`: End-to-end request time
  - Per-job breakdown: `chosen_ms`, `rejected_ms`, `judge_ms`, `total_ms`
- **Asynchronous Judge Evaluation**: Judge runs in background, non-blocking
  - Jobs complete immediately after chosen/rejected generation
  - Judge evaluation happens asynchronously
  - Reduces perceived job duration by ~30-50%
- **Benchmarking Scripts**: Comprehensive tools for performance testing
  - `scripts/benchmark_workers.sh`: Test multiple worker counts (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 96, 128, 256)
  - `scripts/quick_benchmark.sh`: Quick 3-point benchmark
  - Automatic results aggregation with CSV export
  - Performance metrics: throughput, avg job time, rate wait, blocking %
- **BENCHMARK_README.md**: Complete guide for running performance tests

### Changed
- **Concurrency Recommendations Updated**: Based on actual benchmark data
  - Old recommendation: 4-16 workers
  - New recommendation: **64-256 workers** for maximum throughput
  - Benchmark results (32 jobs, NVIDIA NIM + local Phi-4):
    - 16 workers: 7.06/min | 32 workers: 7.57/min | 64 workers: 11.91/min
    - 96 workers: 14.79/min | **256 workers: 17.60/min** (2.5x faster than old recommendation)
- Worker pool scales much better with provider rate limiting
- Updated all configuration examples with realistic worker counts
- Enhanced logging to show provider rate limit configuration at startup

### Fixed
- Multiple models using same provider no longer create duplicate rate limiters
- Rate limit errors reduced when using shared provider endpoints (main + judge on same API)
- Unnecessary nil checks removed from map length checks (Go best practices)

### Performance
- **2.5x throughput improvement** with high worker counts (256 workers vs 16 workers)
- Provider rate limiting prevents 429 errors while maintaining high throughput
- Async judge evaluation reduces job completion time perception
- Better utilization of available API quota with provider-level coordination

### Documentation
- Updated concurrency recommendations in README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, config.toml, config.example.toml
- Added provider rate limiting configuration examples
- Added burst capacity tuning guidelines
- Added benchmark data to support higher worker count recommendations

  - `UploadLFSFileWithRetry()`: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
  - Configurable maximum retries via `MaxRetries` constant
- **Enhanced HTTP Timeout Configuration**: Separated timeout concerns for different operations
  - DefaultTimeout: 300s (general operations)
  - PreuploadTimeout: 300s (LFS preupload requests)
  - LFSUploadTimeout: 600s (LFS file uploads)
  - CommitTimeout: 300s (commit operations)

- HuggingFace upload module now automatically creates proper `.gitattributes` file during uploads
- `.gitattributes` explicitly excludes `*.jsonl` files from LFS to ensure proper text rendering in dataset viewer

### Fixed
- **Critical Dataset Schema Bug**: Fixed type inconsistency in `calculateAverageScore()` function
  - Changed `return 0` to `return 0.0` to ensure float64 type consistency
  - Prevents PyArrow schema validation errors in HuggingFace dataset viewer
  - Affected 16% of dataset records (166/1038) in previous version
- HuggingFace upload failures due to HTTP timeouts for large files (18MB+)
- Network resilience: transient failures no longer cause entire upload to fail
- JSON parsing errors from judge model responses with single-quoted strings
- HuggingFace dataset viewer now properly renders newlines in JSONL files instead of showing literal `\n\n`

### Performance
- Expected upload success rate improvement: 0% → 95%+
- Expected generation success rate improvement: 99.71% → 99.9%+
- Reduced upload failures from timeout issues
