## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- Automatic `.gitattributes` generation in HuggingFace uploads to prevent JSONL files from being stored in Git LFS with `-text` flag
- Comprehensive documentation on newline encoding for training datasets
- Analysis tools for dataset schema validation

### Changed
- HuggingFace upload module now automatically creates proper `.gitattributes` file during uploads
- `.gitattributes` explicitly excludes `*.jsonl` files from LFS to ensure proper text rendering in dataset viewer

### Fixed
- HuggingFace dataset viewer now properly renders newlines in JSONL files instead of showing literal `\n\n`
- Improved documentation on dataset encoding standards for LLM training

---

## [1.3.7] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Retry Logic for HuggingFace Uploads**: Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism for LFS preupload and file upload operations
  - `PreuploadLFSWithRetry()`: 3 attempts with 2s, 4s, 8s delays
  - `UploadLFSFileWithRetry()`: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
  - Configurable maximum retries via `MaxRetries` constant
- **Enhanced HTTP Timeout Configuration**: Separated timeout concerns for different operations
  - DefaultTimeout: 300s (general operations)
  - PreuploadTimeout: 300s (LFS preupload requests)
  - LFSUploadTimeout: 600s (LFS file uploads)
  - CommitTimeout: 300s (commit operations)
- **Improved JSON Sanitization**: Enhanced `SanitizeJSON()` to handle single-quoted property values
  - Automatically converts `"key": 'value'` to `"key": "value"`
  - Properly escapes double quotes within single-quoted strings
  - Fixes issues with judge responses from kimi-k2-instruct-0905

### Changed
- Refactored `Uploader` struct to use four separate HTTP clients for different operation types
- Increased default HTTP timeout from 120s to 300-600s depending on operation type
- `Upload()` method now uses retry-enabled functions for LFS operations

### Fixed
- **Critical Dataset Schema Bug**: Fixed type inconsistency in `calculateAverageScore()` function
  - Changed `return 0` to `return 0.0` to ensure float64 type consistency
  - Prevents PyArrow schema validation errors in HuggingFace dataset viewer
  - Affected 16% of dataset records (166/1038) in previous version
- HuggingFace upload failures due to HTTP timeouts for large files (18MB+)
- Network resilience: transient failures no longer cause entire upload to fail
- JSON parsing errors from judge model responses with single-quoted strings


### Performance
- Expected upload success rate improvement: 0% → 95%+
- Expected generation success rate improvement: 99.71% → 99.9%+
- Reduced upload failures from timeout issues
